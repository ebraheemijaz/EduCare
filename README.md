# EduCare

# Inspiration
Students from underdeveloped areas don't have access to enough details about the admissions in differenet universities. Our inspiration are students from remote & rural areas who have great potential but not proper guidelines to pursue their future goals.

# What it does
We provide a platform which will provide information about all the universities and their admission details, living expenses and student jobs in the particular city. This platform will promote student job eco-system which will make a great impact on lower middle and middle class population.

# How I built it
I build it by indulging different individual web components together like bootstrap, html,javascript and css. I programmed it to give life to it.
