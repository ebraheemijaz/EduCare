# EduCare

# Inspiration
Students from underdeveloped areas don't have access to enough details about the admissions in different universities. Our inspiration are students from those areas who have great potential but not proper guidelines to pursue their future goals along with skill related jobs which wil help them to manage their expenses.

# What it does
We provide a platform which will provide information about all the universities and their admission details, living expenses and student jobs in the particular city. This platform will promote student job eco-system which will make a great impact on lower middle and middle class population.

# How I built it
I build it by indulging different individual web components together like bootstrap, html,javascript and css. I programmed it to give life to it.
